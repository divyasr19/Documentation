list:
list can able to store different datatypes
lists are mutable,i.e,we can modify whenever we want
lists are enclosed by[] and seperated by ","
The items in list are identified by index
It allows duplication of elements
the starting index is 0 and ending index is n-1
structure of list:
list_var=[ele,ele1,ele,.....]
lists have negative index also
len-no. of elements in the list
slicing gives a piece of list,it can be done by :
  list_var[start:stop:step] 
we can create list within list which is nested list


list methods:
append:adds the element at the end 
extend:we can pass multiple values as list

Difference between append and extend:
append considers list values as single elmemt
extend considers list values as individual element

copy:it copies the list and returns it,after copy operation we cannot update anything
clear:it removes all elements from list
count:it returns how many times the vlue is 
index:it returns index of particular value
insert:it inserts value at desired positin
pop: it removes elemt at given index
remove:it removes  ele whatever value we have given
reverse:it returns total list in the reverse order
sort: it returns total list in ascending order
